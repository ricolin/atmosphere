fixes:
  - |
    Manila now uses Nova micro-version 2.60 by default. This change
    enables support for attaching multiple volumes to an instance.
  - |
    Manila now connects to the internal Nova and Glance endpoints
    instead of the public ones. This improves performance and reduces
    reliance on external network paths.
